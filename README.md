# CodeOnTap Infrastructure Deployment Documentation

This repo contains a Jekyll site used to generate infrastructure documentation created by the codeontap generation and deployment process.

## Usage

Update the _data/blueprint_nav.json to include your new deployment. When the codeontap deployment process kicks off the blueprint data will be uploaded to your instance of this site. The site will then rebuild and display the infrastructure details under the menu that you created.
